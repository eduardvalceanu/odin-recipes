    <h1>About this project</h1>
    <div class="content">
     <p>This project is part of <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/about" target="_blank">the Odin Project</a></p>
     <p>The Odin Project only provided the basic html knowledge for a website, and then gave me freehand to explore and use my own creativty to create this project.</p>
     <p>I used a lot of youtube videos on different elements, forums when faced with problems I couldn't solve and a lot of trial and error.</p>
     <p>If an experienced programmer would look at this project's code will probably see a mess, but writing it helped me understand concepts, and lay out a strong foundation to build on.</p>
     <p>Please view the project on a desktop resolution (1920x1080), as it is completely non responsive.</p>
